# port.js

port.js is an expanded version of
[Michael Gundlach’s Chrome (and Opera<em>!</em>)–to–Safari porting library for extensions](https://adblockforchrome.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/port.js).

## Dev HOWTO

Add as the first script to your Safari plist file (created by the Extension
Builder) and your Chrome and Opera manifest files, background pages, and options
pages.

Then use `chrome.*` APIs as usual and check the global `SAFARI` boolean for
doing browser-specific stuff. The `safari.*` APIs will still be available in
Safari and the `chrome.*` APIs unchanged in Chrome and Opera.
